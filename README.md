Project 0x00: Fix My Code
Welcome to Project 0x00: Fix My Code! In this project, we aim to identify and fix issues in provided code snippets. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions, and information about the code fixing process.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to practice debugging and troubleshooting skills by addressing errors, bugs, and issues in existing code. Participants are presented with code snippets containing errors, and their task is to identify the problems and apply appropriate fixes to make the code functional.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

code_snippets/: Contains the code snippets with errors to be fixed.
fixed_code/: Stores the corrected versions of the code snippets.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions, and information about the code fixing process.
Fixing Code
To fix the code snippets, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x00-fix_my_code.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd 0x00-fix_my_code
Review the code snippets located in the code_snippets/ directory. Each snippet contains errors that need to be addressed.

Identify the errors in the code, which may include syntax errors, logic errors, or runtime errors.

Apply appropriate fixes to address the identified issues and make the code functional.

Once you've fixed a code snippet, save the corrected version in the fixed_code/ directory with a descriptive filename.

Repeat the process for each code snippet until all errors have been fixed.

Test the corrected code snippets to ensure they function as intended.
